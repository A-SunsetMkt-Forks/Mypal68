/*
 * Motivation: For truly smooth animation and video playback, we need to
 * be able to compose frames and render them on a dedicated thread (i.e.
 * off the main thread where DOM manipulation, script execution and layout
 * induce difficult-to-bound latency). This requires Gecko to construct
 * some kind of persistent scene structure (graph or tree) that can be
 * safely transmitted across threads. We have other scenarios (e.g. mobile
 * browsing) where retaining some rendered data between paints is desired
 * for performance, so again we need a retained scene structure.
 *
 * Our retained scene structure is a layer tree. Each layer represents
 * content which can be composited onto a destination surface; the root
 * layer is usually composited into a window, and non-root layers are
 * composited into their parent layers. Layers have attributes (e.g.
 * opacity and clipping) that influence their compositing.
 *
 * We want to support a variety of layer implementations, including
 * a simple "immediate mode" implementation that doesn't retain any
 * rendered data between paints (i.e. uses cairo in just the way that
 * Gecko used it before layers were introduced). But we also don't want
 * to have bifurcated "layers"/"non-layers" rendering paths in Gecko.
 * Therefore the layers API is carefully designed to permit maximally
 * efficient implementation in an "immediate mode" style. See the
 * BasicLayerManager for such an implementation.

 * All modifications to a layer tree must happen inside a transaction.
 * Only the state of the layer tree at the end of a transaction is

 *
 * Each transaction has two phases:
 * 1) Construction: layers are created, inserted, removed and have
 * properties set on them in this phase.
 * BeginTransaction and BeginTransactionWithTarget start a transaction in
 * the Construction phase.
 * 2) Drawing: PaintedLayers are rendered into in this phase, in tree
 * order. When the client has finished drawing into the PaintedLayers, it should
 * call EndTransaction to complete the transaction.
 *
 * All layer API calls happen on the main thread.
 *
 * Layers are refcounted. The layer manager holds a reference to the

   * its hit region but outside the dispatch-to-content region, we can initiate
   * a gesture without consulting the content thread. Otherwise we must dispatch
   * the event to content. Note that if a layer or any ancestor layer has a
