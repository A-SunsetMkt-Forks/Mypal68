**WARNING**

This browser does not run well on winxp SP2 and lower. If you do not want to install SP3, be ready for crashes and blue screens.
If you are on SP2 and lower, there is no need to post a screenshot from blue_screen_view. And i suggest to apply postready updates of 2019.
Some say that it runs fine on sp2 but it is no accurate data what to do.

**Since the september i will decline the gethub becuase of the force authentication - for new stuff look the MSFN**

**IF YOU GOT A BLUE SCREEN**

Don't post a screenshot of the blue screen, as the screen isn't useful for troubleshooting.
BSOD happens only on winxp and only when multiprocess enabled, but not for all. Many still use the browser with multiprocess and without BSOD,
Furthermore there is a certain setting that induces BSOD **layers.omtp.enabled** this stand for off-main-thread painting
and invented for perfomance. For more data look [#3](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/issues/3), and please do not make new duplicate reports.


**IF YOU GOT A CRASH BUT WITHOUT BLUE SCREEN**

Please post drwatson.log only. Do not post any irrelevent logs.
Drwatsin log is usually inside All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Dr Watson
